## General Info
Flashcard is a university project but also helps me to better understand Spring, Hibernate and client-server architecture.
I think everybody knows paper flashcard, but I think better option it to use technology. With this app you 
can easily create new set, change languages, check your score and personalize your set with colors.

## Technologies Used
* Java 17
* JavaFX 17
* CSS
* PostgreSQL
* Hibernate
* Spring
* Gson

## Setup
**You can [download it here](https://github.com/bladeours/homeBudget/releases/tag/v0.0.1)**
<br>
In package is whole Java 17, so you don't have to worry about installing right version of Java. All you have to do it unzip downloaded file and run `homeBudget.exe`.
<br>
At this moment there is only version for Windows but in the near future I'll add Linux support.

## First steps
**Remove sample data:**
<br>
1. Click big checkbox in the header of Purchases or Incomes Table
2. Go to purchases/incomes menu
3. Click remove purchase/income

**Add new shop**
<br>
* Just write name of the new shop in "New shop" text-field, this text-field has bigger priority than list with shops.
